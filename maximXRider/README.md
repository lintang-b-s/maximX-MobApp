   ```

   server pmtiles

   ```bash
      mkdir martin
      cd martin

      # Download some sample data
      curl -L -O https://github.com/maplibre/martin/raw/main/tests/fixtures/mbtiles/world_cities.mbtiles

      # Download the latest version of Martin binary, extract it, and make it executable
      curl -L -O https://github.com/maplibre/martin/releases/latest/download/martin-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
      tar -xzf martin-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz

   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
